- Technical Proficiency: Skilled in C, Python, Java, C++, and C# programming, STM32 microcontrollers, software development, and hardware interfacing.
- Problem-Solving: Effective troubleshooter with a strong ability to identify and resolve technical issues.
- Mentorship and Teaching: Experienced in guiding and supporting students in coding, project development, and understanding complex technical concepts.
- Innovative Project Development: Demonstrated track record of successfully designing, developing, and assembling a range of electronic systems, including robots, pcb's, and embedded software projects.

Here are some cool fun facts about me:
- I am graduating just three years of undergrad studies.
- I am planning to pursue a masters in embedded systems engineering at Boulder.
- I played varisty hockey and varsity lacrosse in high school.
